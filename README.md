# QRNG Development Repository â€“ Component Overview and Execution Instructions

This document provides an overview of the main development repository for the QRNG project, including a breakdown of its core components and instructions for execution using Docker Compose.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is composed of the following principal components:

- **API (`backend/`)**: A Node.js-based service that exposes endpoints for communication with the QRNG card and the underlying database.
- **Database (`database/`)**: A MySQL-based relational database initialized using SQL scripts to support the storage and retrieval of QRNG data.
- **Frontend (`frontend/`)**: A web interface built using modern web technologies, designed to interact with the API and provide user-facing features.

## Running the Development Environment

The entire development environment is containerized. To build and start all services, use the following command from the root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will initiate the API server, database, and frontend in their respective containers, as defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Cleaning the Environment

In cases where configuration changes or volume resets are required, it is advisable to remove all associated Docker volumes. This can be done with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
```

This will ensure that all persistent data and container volumes are deleted and a fresh setup can be executed.
